# NLTK Applications Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various applications of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). NLTK is a powerful library for natural language processing (NLP) and is widely used in the analysis and manipulation of textual data.

## Installation

Before running the scripts or notebooks, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

Additionally, you may need to download specific NLTK datasets and models. This can be done by running the NLTK downloader:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('all')
```

## Applications

### 1. Text Classification
- **Spam Detection**: Classify emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of text data such as social media posts or product reviews.

### 2. Tokenization
- **Sentence Tokenization**: Split text into individual sentences.
- **Word Tokenization**: Break down text into individual words or tokens.

### 4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Extracting Entities**: Identify and classify entities like names, organizations, and locations in text.

### 5. Part-of-Speech Tagging
- **Tagging Words**: Assign part-of-speech tags to words in a sentence.

### 6. Parsing and Syntactic Analysis
- **Parsing Sentences**: Analyze the grammatical structure of sentences.

### 7. Word Sense Disambiguation
- **Contextual Meaning**: Determine the correct meaning of a word based on its context.

### 8. Text Generation
- **Automatic Text Generation**: Generate text using probabilistic models.

### 9. Language Modeling
- **Building Language Models**: Predict the probability of word sequences.

### 10. Machine Translation
- **Translation Models**: Build simple models for language translation.

### 11. Corpora Management
- **Working with Corpora**: Access and manipulate various text corpora.

### 12. Concordance and Collocations
- **Finding Words in Context**: Find word occurrences and frequently appearing word pairs.

### 13. Text Summarization
- **Summarizing Text**: Extract key sentences to create a summary.

### 14. Question Answering Systems
- **QA Models**: Develop systems that answer questions posed in natural language.

### 15. Building Chatbots
- **Conversational Agents**: Create rule-based chatbots for interactive applications.

### 16. Information Retrieval
- **Search Engines**: Develop search engines for retrieving relevant information from text databases.

### 17. Topic Modeling
- **Topic Identification**: Identify main topics in a collection of documents.

### 18. Plagiarism Detection
- **Comparing Texts**: Detect similarities between texts to identify potential plagiarism.

## Usage

Each application is contained within its own directory or Jupyter notebook. To run an example, navigate to the respective directory and execute the Python script or open the Jupyter notebook.

Example:

```bash
cd text_classification
python spam_detection.py
```

Or if using Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
```
